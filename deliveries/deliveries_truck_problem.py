    An instance of this class is returned as an operator cost by the method

    The `SearchNode`s that will be created during the run of the search algorithm are going
     to have instances of `DeliveryCost` in SearchNode's `cost` field (instead of float value).
    The reason for using a custom type for the cost (instead of just using a `float` scalar),
     is because we want the cumulative cost (of each search node and particularly of the final
     node of the solution) to be consisted of 3 objectives: (i) distance, (ii) time, and
     (iii) money.
    The field `optimization_objective` controls the objective of the problem (the cost we want
     the solver to minimize). In order to tell the solver which is the objective to optimize,
     we have the `get_g_cost()` method, which returns a single `float` scalar which is only the
     cost to optimize.
    This way, whenever we get a solution, we can inspect the 3 different costs of that solution,
     even though the objective was only one of the costs (time for example).
    Having said that, note that during this assignment we will mostly use the distance objective.

        This method represents the `Succ: S -> P(S)` function of the deliveries truck problem.
        The `Succ` function is defined by the problem operators as shown in class.
        The deliveries truck problem operators are defined in the assignment instructions.
        It receives a state and iterates over its successor states.
        Notice that this its return type is an *Iterator*. It means that this function is not
         a regular function, but a `generator function`. Hence, it should be implemented using
         the `yield` statement.
        For each successor, an object of type `OperatorResult` is yielded. This object describes the
            successor state, the cost of the applied operator and its name. Look for its definition
            and use the correct fields in its c'tor. The operator name should be in the following
            format: `pick ClientName` (with the correct client name) if a pick operator was applied,
            or `drop ClientName` if a drop operator was applied. The delivery object stores its
            client name in one of its fields.

            - The method `self.get_deliveries_waiting_to_pick()` here.
            - The method `self.map_distance_finder.get_map_cost_between()` to calculate
              the operator cost. Its returned value is the operator cost (as is).
            - The c'tor for `DeliveriesTruckState` to create the new successor state.
            - Python's built-in method `frozenset()` to create a new frozen set (for fields that
              expect this type).
            - Other fields of the state and the problem input.
